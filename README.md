## UseCases
* Our solution keeps users more engaged to the 3D world with interactive UI, which helps in attracting more and more customers.

* On purchasing any product, along with the product the user even gets the NFT of the product which gives them the ownership for the product in digital world as well. Using this he/she can flaunt about it digitally as well.

* User gets a 3D view of the product in the shop which makes it look more realistic and the AR view will basically help to enable the ‚Äútry on apparel‚Äù feature.

* Our solution provides both types of buying features,i.e,buying items from the Metacommerce using ‚ÄúMANA tokens‚Äù or buying it through Flipkart‚Äôs website whose link is provided in the respective 3D models.

## Features
* *3D space/Avatar* :-The 3D space which we are using here is the Decentraland which is a virtual world and gives numerous features.One of them is building customizable avatars which helps the user to give itself a unique identity.

* *Flipkart Supercoins* :- We have added flipkart‚Äôs supercoins as a token of gift to all the new customers .Also on every purchase,some of these supercoins depending on the price of the item will be given to the customers.

* *Interactive UI* :- To attract more and more customers we have provided stuffs like Atari gaming console,Flipkart‚Äôs NFT marketplace where users can buy NFTs,a big LCD screen to display promotional videos and to launch products/assets digitally.

* *Building The Main flipkart shop* :- Here we have displayed the 3D models of the apparels on which the user can simply tap on and visit the site to purchase it.They can also scan the the attached QR-code to try-on the apparel in AR view.They can also purchase the item using the ‚ÄúMANA token‚Äù and in return the ‚ÄúNFT‚Äù of that product will be transferred to the user‚Äôs linked wallet.This way the user will own the product digitally as well !

* *Shop For Flipkart Plus Members* :- To the users who buys the flipkart plus membership, we‚Äôll provide them an exclusive NFT token.Now at the entry gate of this shop there is a scanner which scans the user and checks if the user owns that particular NFT or not.If the user has that token, the entry access is confirmed or else the entry is denied ! Once the access is confirmed,the user gets to enter the shop and enjoy the extra perks and benefits provided by ‚ÄúFlipkart Plus‚Äù.

## Future Aspects
 * Firstly, the *‚Äúpurchasing‚Äù* of product by the user.What we have planned to do is that we will generate a *NFT* of each product.Now the user will purchase the product using the *‚ÄúMANA tokens‚Äù* as currency and in return the NFT of that product will be *transferred* to the user.In this way the user can even flaunt about the item which they own *digitally* as well.Now this product gets delivered to the user in real world.So this is how the metaverse will work -it will connect the virtual world created to the real world we live in !

* Secondly,adding *‚ÄúYour Orders‚Äù* section to create a *‚ÄúFlipkart wallet‚Äù* where all the NFT‚Äôs owned by the user will be visible.

* We are even working on the *‚Äúcamera enabling‚Äù feature* , where multiple users can *video chat* with each other !
